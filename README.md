#Open CMS

Status: Under Development

A light-weighted Open-Source CMS, it is being developed with the idea in mind to have this as very light-weighted, lazy, and any level/kind of enhancement support, with having all the controls to programmers not the CMS. Programmer should control CMS not vice-versa.
